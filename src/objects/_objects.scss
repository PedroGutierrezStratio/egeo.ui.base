// Objects
//
// The CSS Objects are classes which provides a functionality but cannot be considered components
// themselves because have not a specific UI. For example, the media object applies a specific
// alignment or the box-shadow object provides a way to share the same box-shadow across the whole
// app.
//
// These objects could be used as independent pieces of code, combined with components and/or other
// items of the framework or ignored. Much of them are used internally by the components to re-use
// code and provide a coherent experience across the UI.
