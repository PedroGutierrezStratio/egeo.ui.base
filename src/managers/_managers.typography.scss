// Typography Manager
//
// The typography manager is the set of settings and functions to work
// with fonts in Egeo. It provides several Sass maps with the whole font 
// families, weights and sizes defined by the Design Team in the 
// [visual specification](/ui-docs/section-2.html) as well as the line
// heights.
//
// All these Sass maps are defined as !default so it is perfectly
// possible redefine them via theming to adapt it to all possibilities.
//
