// Components
//
// The components are the core of the CSS Base Framework. But, What is a component? 
// An UI Component is all element that can be re-used and provides a defined UI to 
// be shown in a webapp. A sample of components could be an Input Text Box, a Checkbox,
//  a Menu Item or a Carousel.
//
// Don't mind the complexity, the size or the skins of the component. A component
// may be formed, in turn, by other smaller components and, in fact, this is the
// ideal and the concept behind this architecture to rise the reusability to the
// maximum.
