// Managers
//
// The Base Framework of Egeo includes a series of managers to encapsulate the access 
// to the original data structures. It works like an API inside the Sass code. This 
// keeps the system flexible and decoupled allowing that if we want to modify the 
// data structures in the future to a better performance or more correct approach 
// we can do it only changing the structure and the API. This is particularly useful 
// when we want to adapt our code to a new version of Sass or if we plan to add a new 
// 3rd party library.
